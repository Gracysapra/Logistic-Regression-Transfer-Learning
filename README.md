# Logistic-Regression-Transfer-Learning
This project explores transfer learning by modularizing a Logistic Regression model. The core idea is to train a logistic regression model in one Python script, save the model as a module, and reuse it in another script for predictions. The project emphasizes the flexibility of model reuse in different applications.

## Key Steps in the Project:
### Training the Logistic Regression Model:

In the first script, the dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
A Logistic Regression model is trained to predict a target variable using relevant features.
The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated through metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix.
### Saving the Model as a Module:

The logistic regression model is encapsulated in a Python module, allowing it to be imported and reused in other files.
This approach highlights modularization, making the model portable and reusable.
### Using the Module for Prediction:

In the second script, the trained logistic regression model is imported from the module.
New data is fed into the model for predictions, demonstrating the flexibility of transfer learning across different use cases.
## Features:
Transfer Learning: The project focuses on creating a logistic regression model once and reusing it across different tasks or files.
Modularization: The logistic regression model is saved as a module to showcase the reusability of machine learning models.
Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy and the confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model's performance.
This project is an excellent example of leveraging modularization and transfer learning to improve efficiency and reuse in machine learning applications.
