# Logistic-Regression-Transfer-Learning
This project explores transfer learning by modularizing a Logistic Regression model. The core idea is to train a logistic regression model in one Python script, save the model as a module, and reuse it in another script for predictions. The project emphasizes the flexibility of model reuse in different applications.
